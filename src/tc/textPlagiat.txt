The first thanks from me is to the
God for giving me idea and time to be able
to finish this paper successfully. Special
acknowledgment belongs to Rinaldi Munir, discrete
mathematic lecturer in Bandung Institute of Technology,
to be really nice in teaching, also by giving me the
task to write this paper so I could at least
practice to write an excellent paper and to learn about
computer science deeper. Last but not least, other thanks
will I give to my parents as they
continuously support the author to undergo a college life
in Bandung Institute of Technology.
